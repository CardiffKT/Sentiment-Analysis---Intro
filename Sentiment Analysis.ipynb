    "## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular applications of Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "- Movies: To understand people's thoughts on the movies.\n",
    "- Business: Helps a business understand their customers' feelings towards their products or brand; develop strategies for compaigns or product launches.\n",
    "- Politics: To interpret people's views on the statements and actions at the government level. Also, could be used to predict election results!\n",
    "- Public Actions: To monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere."
